-This dashboard is representing the data for company "Divvy Bike-Sharing Chicago" for month December 2022. In this project we can see few crucial points which helps us to understand in which days people tend to rent bikes and what type of bikes people mostly rent. Also we can see if people tend to rent bikes on longer period or shorter period and if members or casual users mosly rent bikes in this company and what kind of bike they prefere.

Before creating the dashboard, there is few data transformations done, like creating columns :started_at_day_number, ended_at_day_number, started_at_day_name, ended_at_day_name, started_at_timestamp, ended_at_timestamp, ride_duration, ride_duration_minutes,number_of_trips_under_1_minute, number_of_trips_between_1m_and_30m, number_of_trips_between_30m_1h, number_of_trips_more_than_1h.

All of this columns helped later in creating power pivot tables in order to create the charts.

Some of the formulas used :
-CountIFS
-SUM
-IF(nested)
-TEXT
-LARGE
